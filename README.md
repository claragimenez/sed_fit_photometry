# sed_fit_photometry
SED-Fitting tool for spatially-resolved photometric observations.

AUTHOR: Clara Giménez Arteaga, University of Copenhagen, clara.arteaga_at_nbi.ku.dk; Gabriel Brammer, University of Copenhagen

PURPOSE: SED-Fitting for spatially-resolved photometry. Can particularly be useful to extract line fluxes from narrow-band imaging, by robustly fitting and subtracting the continuum. Outputs physical properties such as the stellar mass, star formation rate and visual extinction Av.

EXPLANATION: Further information on the algorithm can be found in Giménez-Arteaga et al. in prep.
